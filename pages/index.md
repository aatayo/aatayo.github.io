# About Me
<br>

Hi, I am **Asonganyi (Ateh) Atayo**. :wave:
<br>  

I am currently a student in the Ph.D. **Mechanical Engineering** program at Wichita State University. Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I received my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from WSU, where I developed various skills in Mechanical design, engineering simulations, and mathematics. I am interested in the **Semiconductor & Hardware industry**, and my projects involve **phase change heat transfer, thermal energy storage, computational fluid dynamics, computer vision and machine/deep learning, etc.**
